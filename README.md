# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme
I have always been a big fan of Mario and have watched Youtube videos where the person does some kind of movement challenge, so that inspired me here with only being able to move forward

## Game Play
Get to the end to earn your reward without being hit by the enemies. The catch is you can only move forward. No jumping or going back. 

## What did you 
Wanted to add some more things but found it difficult giving the player is limited with one button 

## Implementation
-Descriptive readme that explains the game +2
-Gameplay that has an end goal +2
-Repository with at least 10 commits +2
-Coins to symbolize the player has done well +1
-Multiple enemies to make getting to the end challenging 
-Gameplay happens on level +2
-Ground is styled and made to look authentic +1 


## Special Focus
What is your special focus? What did you do for it? How would you rate your own effort? 1-5. (I will agree or disagree with this sentiment, but I want to know what you thought)
